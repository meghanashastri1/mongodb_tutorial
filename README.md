    - I was having trouble connecting to the cluster I created on the cloud, so used an example on w3schools to connect to a general database
    - used this to create the inventory collection and populate it 

Problems:
- collection is not being populated, not able to connect with cloud cluster (I followed the Atlas tutorial and installed the mongo shell, still wasn't connecting)
